## SVG URL ENCODER

This application helps to get ready CSS code from SVG. Without encoding SVG works only in Webkit based browsers. You can use the ready-made CSS code for embedding into the background, mask or border-image. ```EncodeURIComponent()``` is used for encoding, so the resulting code will work in any browser!
